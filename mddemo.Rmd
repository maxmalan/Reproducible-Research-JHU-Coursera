My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here we're going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
``` 

LEt's first make a pairs of plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```
Here's a regression model with ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```
